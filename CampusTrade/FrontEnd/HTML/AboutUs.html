                <div class="desc1">At CampusTrade, we believe that students can build a thriving community by exchanging goods, services, and knowledge without the need for money. We’ve created a platform that allows students to barter books, resources, and skills such as tutoring or assignment help. Whether you’re looking to swap textbooks, exchange notes, or offer help with assignments, CampusTrade is your one-stop solution for connecting with fellow students.

We understand that students often face financial challenges, which is why we offer affordable items at significantly lower prices than traditional marketplaces. Even if you don’t have money, you can still access the items you need using CampusCoins, our platform’s unique coin-based system. We aim to promote sustainability, collaboration, and affordability in student communities, ensuring that everyone can find what they need without breaking the bank.

                        How It Works
                        
                        At CampusTrade, we’ve made the process simple and flexible. Here’s how it works:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. CampusCoins: Every time you complete a transaction on CampusTrade, you earn CampusCoins. These coins are awarded based on the value of the transaction, with a fixed number of coins for barter exchanges. You can save up these coins and use them for future trades, so even if you’re low on cash, you can still get what you need.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2. Online to Offline Transactions: We also support online chats between users, so you can discuss and finalize your trades. Once agreed upon, you can meet offline to complete the exchange in person. This allows for a more personalized and flexible experience when arranging deals.
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3. Bartering for Same-Division Students: For students within the same division or department, we offer a seamless bartering system. If you and another student are in close proximity, you can directly trade items or services through our platform, making the process quick and easy.
